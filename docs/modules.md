## Somewhat stable

Code works and it has been minimally tested, but not proper testsuite integration or automated testing process has been implemented.

- [typebox](https://github.com/KaruroChori/typebox-txiki-module): based on [typebox](https://github.com/sinclairzx81/typebox), just a thin wrapper and some magic to make types work.
- [commander](https://github.com/KaruroChori/commander-txiki-module): based on [commander.js](https://github.com/tj/commander.js); a major refactoring to move the codebase from sync to async & to remove the dependencies from node native modules.
- [demo](https://github.com/KaruroChori/demo-txiki-module): it is just a basic skeleton repository for reference; an example on how to structure your own project.

## Ongoing

Development started, not in a usable state.

- [serial](https://github.com/KaruroChori/serial-txiki-module): custom native module to configure serial devices (likely unix only).
- [lvgl](https://github.com/KaruroChori/lvgl-txiki-module): native module to use lvgl via react bindings.
