## What are txiki modules?

WIP, consider https://github.com/saghul/txiki.js/discussions/514 for now.

## Getting started

## Features

## Resources

List of available modules is [here](./docs/modules.md).

JSON schemas for the `module.json` and `modules.json` files in [here](./schemas/out/).  
If your application allows that, you can directly use the typebox-based schemas.

Reference repository for a [demo module](https://github.com/KaruroChori/demo-txiki-module) to get started.
